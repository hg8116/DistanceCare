# Distance Care

Introducing our new app, which had been created to make it easier for patients to access healthcare services from the comfort of their homes in rural and remote areas. With the help of our app, patients can easily make video calls with doctors.

People who live in remote areas or have limited mobility and are unable to travel to a clinic or hospital for medical consultation are the perfect candidates for this app. Patients can make an appointment with a doctor and engage in a secure video call with them with just a few mouse clicks. Patients will receive the same level of care through the app as they would in person.

Patients can communicate with doctors using our app from any location with an internet connection thanks to its simplicity and accessibility. For patients who want to avoid the expense and inconvenience of travelling to a clinic or hospital, the app offers a practical solution.

In general, the goal of our app is to increase patient access to healthcare services and close the communication gap between patients in outlying areas and medical professionals. Our app makes it simpler for patients to receive the medical care they require at the appropriateÂ time.
